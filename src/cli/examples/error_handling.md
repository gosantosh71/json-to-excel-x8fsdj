## Error Handling in the JSON to Excel Conversion Tool

Introduction to error handling in the CLI tool

This document provides guidance on understanding and resolving common errors that may occur when using the JSON to Excel Conversion Tool. The tool is designed to provide clear, actionable error messages to help you quickly identify and fix issues.

## Understanding Error Messages

Explanation of error message structure

Error messages in the tool follow a consistent format to help you understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Each error message includes an error code, a description of the problem, and suggested resolution steps.

## Common Error Categories

Overview of the main error categories

Errors in the JSON to Excel Conversion Tool are categorized into several types: Input Errors (file access issues), Parsing Errors (JSON syntax problems), Transformation Errors (data conversion issues), Output Errors (Excel generation problems), and System Errors (configuration or resource issues).

## File System Errors

Handling errors related to file access

Common file system errors include file not found, permission denied, invalid file type, and file too large errors. This section provides examples of these errors and how to resolve them.

## JSON Parsing Errors

Handling errors related to JSON syntax

JSON parsing errors occur when the input file contains invalid JSON syntax. This section shows examples of common JSON syntax errors, how they appear in the tool's output, and how to fix them.

## JSON Structure Errors

Handling errors related to JSON structure

JSON structure errors occur when the JSON is syntactically valid but doesn't meet the expected format or contains overly complex nested structures. This section provides guidance on simplifying complex JSON and ensuring it can be properly converted.

## Transformation Errors

Handling errors during data transformation

Transformation errors can occur when processing complex JSON structures, especially with deeply nested objects or large arrays. This section covers memory limitations, array handling issues, and other transformation challenges.

## Excel Generation Errors

Handling errors during Excel file creation

Excel generation errors include row/column limit exceeded, formatting issues, and file write problems. This section explains these errors and provides solutions such as data filtering or splitting.

## Using Verbose Mode for Troubleshooting

Getting more detailed error information

The --verbose flag provides additional details when errors occur, which can be invaluable for troubleshooting complex issues. This section demonstrates how to use verbose mode effectively.

## Validation Command for Preventive Error Checking

Using the validate command to prevent errors

The validate command allows you to check if a JSON file is valid and can be converted without actually performing the conversion. This section shows how to use this command to identify potential issues before attempting conversion.

## Example Commands

| Description | Command |
|---|---|
| Using verbose mode to get detailed error information | `python json_to_excel.py convert invalid.json output.xlsx --verbose` |
| Validating a JSON file before conversion | `python json_to_excel.py validate data.json` |
| Handling a file that's too large | `python json_to_excel.py convert large_file.json output.xlsx --chunk-size=1000` |
| Dealing with Excel row limit errors | `python json_to_excel.py convert huge_data.json output.xlsx --split-by="category"` |

## Error Examples

| Error Type | Command | Output | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| File Not Found | `python json_to_excel.py convert missing.json output.xlsx` | `[!] ERROR: Could not read JSON file 'missing.json'`<br>`[!] File not found. Please check the file path and try again.` | Verify that the file exists at the specified path and that you have typed the filename correctly. |
| JSON Syntax Error | `python json_to_excel.py convert malformed.json output.xlsx` | `[!] ERROR: Invalid JSON format in 'malformed.json'`<br>`[!] JSON syntax error at line 15, column 22: Expected ',' delimiter`<br>`[!] Please verify the JSON structure and try again.` | Open the JSON file in a text editor or JSON validator, locate line 15 around column 22, and fix the missing comma. |
| Nested Structure Too Complex | `python json_to_excel.py convert deeply_nested.json output.xlsx` | `[!] ERROR: JSON structure too complex`<br>`[!] Nesting level (12) exceeds maximum supported level (10)`<br>`[!] Consider simplifying the JSON structure or using the --max-nesting-level option.` | Simplify the JSON structure or increase the maximum nesting level using the --max-nesting-level option. |
| Excel Row Limit Exceeded | `python json_to_excel.py convert large_dataset.json output.xlsx` | `[!] ERROR: Excel row limit exceeded`<br>`[!] Data contains 1,500,000 rows, but Excel supports maximum 1,048,576 rows`<br>`[!] Consider splitting the data into multiple sheets or files.` | Use the --split-by option to divide the data across multiple sheets, or filter the data to reduce the number of rows. |
| Memory Error | `python json_to_excel.py convert huge_file.json output.xlsx` | `[!] ERROR: Memory error during processing`<br>`[!] The system ran out of memory while processing the file`<br>`[!] Try using the --chunk-size option to process the file in smaller chunks.` | Use the --chunk-size option to process the file in smaller chunks, which reduces memory usage. |

## Verbose Examples

| Description | Command | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Standard error output | `python json_to_excel.py convert malformed.json output.xlsx` | `[!] ERROR: Invalid JSON format in 'malformed.json'`<br>`[!] JSON syntax error at line 15, column 22: Expected ',' delimiter`<br>`[!] Please verify the JSON structure and try again.` |
| Verbose error output | `python json_to_excel.py convert malformed.json output.xlsx --verbose` | `[!] ERROR: Invalid JSON format in 'malformed.json'`<br>`[!] JSON syntax error at line 15, column 22: Expected ',' delimiter`<br>`[!] Please verify the JSON structure and try again.`<br><br>`[!] Technical Details:`<br>`    Error Code: JSON_PARSE_ERROR`<br>`    Component: JSONParser`<br>`    File: malformed.json`<br>`    Line Content: "name": "John Doe" "email": "john@example.com"`<br>`                                ^`<br>`    Expected: ','`<br>`    Found: '"'` |

## Troubleshooting Tips

| Tip | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Always use the --verbose flag when encountering errors to get more detailed information | The verbose mode provides additional technical details that can help identify the exact cause of the problem. |
| Use the validate command before attempting conversion | The validate command performs a thorough check of the JSON file without attempting conversion, which can help identify issues early. |
| For large files, use the --chunk-size option | Processing large files in chunks reduces memory usage and can prevent memory-related errors. |
| Check file permissions if you encounter access errors | Make sure you have read permissions for input files and write permissions for the output directory. |
| Use a JSON validator to check syntax before conversion | External JSON validators can provide more detailed syntax checking and help identify issues in complex JSON structures. |
