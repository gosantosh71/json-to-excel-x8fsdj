### **Functional Specification: JSON to Excel Conversion Tool Using Python**

----------

### **1. Overview**

The purpose of this tool is to convert a **JSON file** into an **Excel (.xlsx)** file using Python. The tool will take a JSON file as input, process the data, and generate an Excel file with the appropriate structure and formatting. The tool will support different JSON formats (flat and nested) and will output the data into an Excel spreadsheet in a tabular format.

----------

### **2. Functional Requirements**

#### **2.1 Input: JSON File**

- The input will be a **JSON file**, either with simple flat data or with nested data structures.

- The tool should support JSON files in the following formats:

  - **Flat JSON**: A straightforward structure with key-value pairs.

  - **Nested JSON**: JSON data with nested objects or arrays that require flattening.

#### **2.2 Output: Excel File**

- The output will be an **Excel file (.xlsx)**.

- The Excel file will contain one or more sheets:

  - A default sheet named **"Sheet1"** if no custom sheet name is provided.

  - The sheet will contain data extracted from the JSON file, where each key becomes a column and each item in the JSON array becomes a row.

#### **2.3 Features**

1. **Read JSON File**:

   - The system should accept a **JSON file** as input.

   - The file can be uploaded from the local file system or fetched from a URL (optional feature).

2. **JSON Parsing**:

   - If the input JSON is **flat**, it will directly be converted into a tabular format.

   - If the input JSON contains **nested structures**, the system will flatten the data. Nested objects or arrays will be converted into separate columns with compound names (e.g., `address.city`, `address.zipcode`).

3. **Excel Conversion**:

   - The system should create an Excel file using **Pandas** and **openpyxl**.

   - The JSON data will be written into the Excel file in tabular form:

     - Keys in the JSON data will become column headers in the Excel sheet.

     - Values associated with the keys will become the corresponding row values.

4. **Handling Nested Data**:

   - For **nested data**, the tool will normalize it into a flat structure (e.g., nested dictionaries will be expanded into separate columns).

   - Arrays within JSON can either be flattened or converted into multiple rows depending on the structure (optional behavior).

5. **File Export**:

   - The converted Excel file will be saved locally or at a specified path.

   - Users will be able to download the Excel file after the conversion process is completed.

6. **Error Handling**:

   - If the provided JSON file is invalid or not formatted properly, the system will output an appropriate error message.

   - The system should handle missing or incorrect data gracefully by skipping the problematic data or notifying the user.

----------

### **3. User Interface (UI)**

This tool can be used through a **command-line interface (CLI)** or as a **web-based application** with file upload functionality.

#### **3.1 Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

1. **Input**:

   - **Command**: `python json_to_excel.py <input_json_file> <output_excel_file>`

   - The input JSON file will be provided as an argument (e.g., `data.json`).

   - The output Excel file will be saved at the provided file path (e.g., `output.xlsx`).

2. **Expected Command**:

   ```
   python json_to_excel.py data.json output.xlsx
   
   ```

3. **Output**:

   - The tool will generate an **Excel file** named `output.xlsx` in the specified location.

   - The tool will display a message like: 

     ```
     Successfully converted data.json to output.xlsx.
     
     ```

#### **3.2 Web Interface (Optional)**

1. **File Upload**:

   - Users can upload the **JSON file** via a web interface.

   - Users specify the output file name (optional) or the tool will use a default name (e.g., `output.xlsx`).

2. **Process Button**:

   - After uploading the file, the user clicks a **“Convert”** button.

3. **Download Button**:

   - Once the conversion is done, the user is provided with a **download link** to the generated Excel file.

----------

### **4. Data Flow**

1. **User uploads or specifies the input JSON file**.

2. **System reads the JSON file**:

   - If the file is valid, the system proceeds to the next step.

   - If the file is invalid, the system returns an error message.

3. **System flattens nested JSON data (if applicable)**:

   - Any nested objects or arrays are flattened into a table format.

   - Non-nested JSON is directly converted to a table.

4. **System writes data to an Excel file**:

   - The Excel file is created with each key as a column header and each value as a row entry.

5. **User receives the output Excel file**:

   - The file is saved locally or made available for download.

----------

### **5. Technical Specifications**

#### **5.1 Libraries and Tools**

- **Python**: Programming language used to implement the tool.

- **Pandas**: For processing and converting JSON data into a DataFrame.

  - Used to handle the flattening and transformation of JSON data into tabular form.

- **openpyxl**: For writing Excel files in `.xlsx` format.

  - Used for creating and manipulating the Excel workbook and its sheets.

- **json**: For parsing the input JSON file.

- **Flask** (optional, for Web Interface): A lightweight framework for building the web interface.

#### **5.2 Detailed Steps for Conversion**

1. **Read JSON file**:

   - Parse the JSON file using Python’s built-in `json` module.

   - If the JSON is not formatted correctly, display an error message.

2. **Flatten JSON** (if nested):

   - Use `pd.json_normalize()` from Pandas to flatten nested structures. Nested dictionaries will be converted to a column with a compound name (e.g., `address.city`).

3. **Write Data to Excel**:

   - Convert the normalized JSON data into a **Pandas DataFrame**.

   - Use `DataFrame.to_excel()` to write the DataFrame to an Excel file.

4. **Error Handling**:

   - Validate if the file exists and is a valid JSON file before attempting to parse.

   - If data cannot be extracted or converted, log the error and inform the user.

#### **5.3 File Format Specifications**

- **Input Format**: JSON file (.json) containing either flat or nested data.

- **Output Format**: Excel file (.xlsx) generated from the input JSON.

----------

### **6. Performance Requirements**

- The tool should be capable of handling reasonably large JSON files with data sizes up to several megabytes.

- The processing time should be quick, especially for non-nested JSON. For larger files or deeply nested JSON, performance optimization techniques should be considered.

----------

### **7. Testing and Quality Assurance**

#### **7.1 Unit Testing**

- **Test JSON Parsing**: Ensure that the tool can correctly read and parse valid JSON files.

- **Test Flattening**: Verify that the flattening mechanism handles nested structures correctly.

- **Test Excel Writing**: Ensure that the generated Excel file matches the input JSON data in a tabular form.

#### **7.2 Integration Testing**

- Test the complete flow from reading a JSON file to writing it to an Excel file. This should include both simple and complex (nested) JSON files.

#### **7.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

- Perform testing with real-world JSON files of varying complexity to ensure the output Excel files are accurate and well-formatted.

----------

### **8. Maintenance and Support**

#### **8.1 Maintenance**

- Regular updates will be necessary to ensure compatibility with new JSON structures or changes in Excel file formats.

- Support for additional output file formats (e.g., CSV) could be added in future versions.

#### **8.2 Support**

- Provide documentation for users on how to upload JSON files and convert them to Excel.

- Provide an error handling system that notifies users if the conversion fails, including troubleshooting steps.

----------

This functional specification provides a clear roadmap for developing a tool to convert JSON data into an Excel file using Python. The tool will be flexible enough to handle both simple and complex JSON files while ensuring that the output is accurate and easy to use.
